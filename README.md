# crypto_orderbook_generator

Hello! This is a small pet project where I use Python & Jupyter Notebooks to pull data from Coinbase's API.
That data is then used to generate charts & CSV's based on the bids & asks of the price.

The order_book_generator_og.ipynb file should work when running all cells, whereas the other files are different iterations. 

The bots are used to forecast the prices of currencies. I do not gaurantee profit or a financial benefit from using these files, I created these for my own research and curiosity. 

There is also a python script for generating a live animation of the current order book for a designated currency pair from Coinbase.
